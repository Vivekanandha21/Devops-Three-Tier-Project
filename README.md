![Three-Tier Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bazith1/Three-Tier-Project/main/Three-Tier---yellow.gif "Three-Tier Architecture Demo")


## Project Introduction
Welcome to the End-to-End DevSecOps Kubernetes Project guide! This comprehensive project walks you through setting up a robust Three-Tier Architecture on AWS using Kubernetes, DevOps best practices, and advanced security measures. Gain hands-on experience in deploying, securing, and monitoring a scalable application environment.

## Project Overview
This project includes the following key components:

### 1. IAM User Setup
Create an IAM user on AWS with the necessary permissions to facilitate deployment and management activities.

### 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Use Terraform and AWS CLI to set up the Jenkins server on an EC2 instance.

### 3. Jenkins Server Deployment
Deploy the Jenkins Server using Terraform.

### 4. Jenkins Server Configuration
Install and configure essential tools on the Jenkins server:
- Jenkins
- Docker
- SonarQube
- Terraform
- Kubectl
- AWS CLI
- Trivy

### 5. EKS Cluster Deployment
Deploy an Amazon EKS cluster (managed Kubernetes service) using Terraform.

### 6. Jumper Server Deployment
Deploy a Jumper Server via the AWS Console to communicate with the EKS cluster located in a private subnet.

### 7. Load Balancer Configuration
Configure an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) for the EKS cluster.

### 8. Amazon ECR Repositories
Create private repositories for both frontend and backend Docker images using Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

### 9. ArgoCD Installation
Install and set up ArgoCD for continuous delivery and GitOps.

### 10. SonarQube Integration
Integrate SonarQube for code quality analysis in the DevSecOps pipeline.

### 11. Jenkins Pipelines with GitHub Webhook
Create Jenkins pipelines to:
- Deploy backend and frontend code to the EKS cluster.
- Automatically trigger the pipeline using GitHub Webhooks.

### 12. ArgoCD Application Deployment
Use ArgoCD to deploy the Three-Tier application, including:
- Database
- Backend
- Frontend
- Ingress Components

### 13. Monitoring Setup
Implement monitoring for the EKS cluster using:
- Helm
- Prometheus
- Grafana
